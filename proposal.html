<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
<hr>
<h2>What is your website about?</h2>
    <p>
        My website will be all about the New England Patriots and all associated content that will go along
        with the 2022-2023 season. I also want to incorporate all other NFL teams and betting lines. 
    </p>
<h2>What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?)</h2>
    <p>
        This website will aim to display their schedule, any media content that is associated with the team,
        and any significant data and stats that is worth displaying. Other pages will display betting lines, stats,
        and scores from around the league. 
    </p>
<h2>Who is your target audience?</h2>
    <p>
        Anyone who is a New England Patriots fan, as well as anyone who is really interested in stats and scores
        from the weekly matchups. The base of this website will be for New England fans, but it will also reach 
        other demographics of people who are interested in statistics from around the league in order to 
        calculate bets. 
    </p>
<h2>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h2>
    <p>
        I plan on having a page on having pages for the following:
    </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Patriots schedule (utilizing tables)</li>
            <li>Relevant content/social media content</li>
            <li>Information about the Patriots current weekly matchup and specific bets and stats related to the current matchup</li>
            <li>Scores from around the league along with respected stats and betting lines</li>
            <li>Other...</li>
        </ol>
